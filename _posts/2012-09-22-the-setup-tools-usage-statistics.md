title: The Setup Tools Usage Statistics

[The Setup](http://usesthis.com/) is an interesting interview website.
When browsing the latest interview there yesterday, I come out with the
idea to do a simple statistics on the tool usage patterns for the people
interviewed. The first statistic is about the frequency of tools
mentioned by all people. Here is the
[result](http://codingai.appspot.com/demo/usesthis).

There might be noise in the table as I simply grabbed all the links on
individual page, and manually filtered out unrelated links and those
links mentioned only once. The python code is available on
[gist.github](https://gist.github.com/673769).
