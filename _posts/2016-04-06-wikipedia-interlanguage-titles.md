This blog is powered by Jekyll as you might see in the footer. I additionally hacked the layout to display other information regarding the post being displayed. I wanted to give the reader some information prior to reading a post, such as :

- The estimated reading time depending on the length of the post
- The level of the post being displayed that can be **beginner**, **intermediate** or **advanced**
- The category as well as the tags related to the post  
and finally
- The Table of Content of the given post : Every post will be introduced first in a general manner through a figure that describes the main topic and a short explanation with possibly some references and links to further read about the subject being discussed.
